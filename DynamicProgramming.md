If a problem is having the following two properties then it's classified as a DP problem
- Optimal Substructure
- Overlapping Subproblem

Q- What is optimal substructure? 
Ans: It means that you can divide a bigger problem to smaller subproblem, and you aggregate the answers of the smaller subproblem, you will get the answer for the bigger problem i.e. if we use optimal answers of smaller subproblems then the bigger problem will also be solved optimally.

Q- What is iverlapping subproblem?
Ans: If the number of unique states of a problem is less than the total number of states then the problem is said to have overlapping subproblem
